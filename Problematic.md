# Spotify Billboard Hot 100 Analysis

## Dataset
Our chosen dataset was found on Kaggle and is titled **"Billboard Hot 100 Weekly Charts with Spotify Audio Features"**. It encompasses weekly Billboard Hot 100 charts, enriched with Spotify's audio features for each track. This combination offers a comprehensive view of both the chart performance and the musical characteristics of songs over time.

## Motivation
Should you really be writing **POP MUSIC** to make it to the Billboard Hot 100? Music is a universal language powerful enough to evoke emotions, represent cultures, and influence generations. It can uplift spirits, bring nostalgia, or set the perfect mood for any occasion. From high-energy dance tracks that fuel parties to soulful ballads that resonate deeply, music shapes how we feel and interact with the world around us.

But beyond personal experiences, what makes a song widely popular? Does the mood or genre of a song determine its success on the charts? Are certain musical styles more likely to dominate the Billboard Hot 100? By analyzing the ranking of songs alongside their audio features such as energy, tempo, and danceability, we can uncover patterns that explain what captures the attention of millions. 

This project aims to explore whether specific genres or moods consistently achieve top positions and if emerging trends can predict the next big hit. Through data visualization, we seek to decode the relationship between sound, sentiment, and chart success, offering insights into the ever-evolving world of music.

## Research Questions
- **Genre Influence on Chart Performance:** How do different genres correlate with chart positions? Do certain genres have a higher likelihood of reaching top spots?
- **Temporal Genre Trends:** How has the popularity of different genres evolved over the years? Are there dominant genres that define specific eras, or do new styles emerge and reshape the musical landscape?
- **Audio Features & Success Metrics:** What is the relationship between specific audio features (e.g., danceability, energy) and chart success? Are there recognizable patterns that contribute to higher rankings?
- **Spotting Emerging Artists:** How do new artists enter the charts, and what characteristics define tracks that propel them to prominence?

## Target Audience
- **Music Industry Professionals:** Record labels, producers, and talent scouts seeking data-driven insights.
- **Music Enthusiasts:** Fans interested in the dynamics of music trends and chart movements.
- **Artists & Musicians:** Individuals aiming to understand the elements that contribute to chart success.


## Final Goal
To craft interactive and insightful visualizations that narrate the intricate relationship between musical genres, audio characteristics, and chart success, while also spotlighting emerging talent in the industry. This will be done alongside a basic analysis of top artists over the years, identifying trends in their chart performance and understanding how their music aligns with key audio features that drive success. 

By providing an overview of existing patterns in the music industry, we aim to identify key aspects that future artists can harness to optimize their chances of chart success.
