[Milestone 1](#milestone-1) • [Milestone 2](#milestone-2) • [Milestone 3](#milestone-3)

## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work

Several websites and research projects have analyzed trends in the **Billboard Hot 100** and song popularity. While **Billboard.com** provides weekly rankings, it lacks interactive exploration of historical data.

Our main inspiration comes from **The Pudding**, particularly:
- **[“A History of Music Genres”](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/music-history/)**, which visualizes how genres have evolved over time.
- **[“Love Songs Through the Decades”](https://pudding.cool/2024/11/love-songs/)**, analyzing lyrical trends in hit songs.

Other platforms like **Kaggle** and **FiveThirtyEight** have explored factors such as artist trends and the impact of streaming on rankings. However, these analyses are often static, lack interactivity, and do not incorporate **audio elements** or **geographic insights**.

##### Our Project
Our project expands on these ideas by offering a **more immersive experience**, allowing users to:

- **Genre Distribution Over Time** Stacked area charts illustrating the rise and decline of genre popularity over the years (Top 10).
- **Audio Feature Correlations** Heatmaps revealing correlations between audio features and average chart rankings.
- **Artist Debut Analysis** Line graphs tracking the debut and rise of new artists on the charts.
- **Top Features of Hit Songs** Radar charts highlighting the distinctive audio feature profiles of top hits.
- **MoodMap: Hit Predictions** A prediction of the top genre and track based on mood, followed by an analysis of where they would be most listened to today.
