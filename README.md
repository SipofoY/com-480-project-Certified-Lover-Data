# Spotify Billboard Hot 100 Analysis üìäüé∂

## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset
Our chosen datasets, **"[Billboard Hot 100 Weekly Charts with Spotify Audio Features](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/billboard-hot-100-audio-features)"** and **"[Top Spotify Songs in 73 Countries Daily Updated](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/top-spotify-songs-in-73-countries-daily-updated)"**, encompass weekly Billboard Hot 100 charts enriched with Spotify's audio features and daily rankings of the most popular songs across 73 countries, providing valuable insights into global music trends, song popularity, and the relationship between audio features and chart performance.

### Problematic
#### Motivation
Should you really be writing **POP MUSIC** to make it to the Billboard Hot 100? Music is a universal language powerful enough to evoke emotions, represent cultures, and influence generations. It can uplift spirits, bring nostalgia, or set the perfect mood for any occasion. From high-energy dance tracks that fuel parties to soulful ballads that resonate deeply, music shapes how we feel and interact with the world around us.

But beyond personal experiences, what makes a song widely popular? Does the mood or genre of a song determine its success on the charts? Are certain musical styles more likely to dominate the Billboard Hot 100? By analyzing the ranking of songs alongside their audio features such as energy, tempo, and danceability, we can uncover patterns that explain what captures the attention of millions. 

This project aims to explore whether specific genres or moods consistently achieve top positions and if emerging trends can predict the next big hit. Through data visualization, we seek to decode the relationship between sound, sentiment, and chart success, offering insights into the ever-evolving world of music.
#### Research Questions
- **Genre Influence on Chart Performance:** How do different genres correlate with chart positions? Do certain genres have a higher likelihood of reaching top spots?
- **Temporal Genre Trends:** How has the popularity of different genres evolved over the years? Are there dominant genres that define specific eras, or do new styles emerge and reshape the musical landscape?
- **Audio Features & Success Metrics:** What is the relationship between specific audio features (e.g., danceability, energy) and chart success? Are there recognizable patterns that contribute to higher rankings?
- **Spotting Emerging Artists:** How do new artists enter the charts, and what characteristics define tracks that propel them to prominence?
#### Target Audience
- **Music Industry Professionals:** Record labels, producers, and talent scouts seeking data-driven insights.
- **Music Enthusiasts:** Fans interested in the dynamics of music trends and chart movements.
- **Artists & Musicians:** Individuals aiming to understand the elements that contribute to chart success.

### Related work

Several websites and research projects have analyzed trends in the **Billboard Hot 100** and song popularity. While **Billboard.com** provides weekly rankings, it lacks interactive exploration of historical data.

Our main inspiration comes from **The Pudding**, particularly:
- **[‚ÄúA History of Music Genres‚Äù](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/music-history/)**, which visualizes how genres have evolved over time.
- **[‚ÄúLove Songs Through the Decades‚Äù](https://pudding.cool/2024/11/love-songs/)**, analyzing lyrical trends in hit songs.

Other platforms like **Kaggle** and **FiveThirtyEight** have explored factors such as artist trends and the impact of streaming on rankings. However, these analyses are often static, lack interactivity, and do not incorporate **audio elements** or **geographic insights**.

##### Our Project
Our project expands on these ideas by offering a **more immersive experience**, allowing users to:

- **Genre Distribution Over Time:** Stacked area charts illustrating the rise and decline of genre popularity over the years (Top 10).
- **Audio Feature Correlations:** Heatmaps revealing correlations between audio features and average chart rankings.
- **Artist Debut Analysis:** Line graphs tracking the debut and rise of new artists on the charts.
- **Top Features of Hit Songs:** Radar charts highlighting the distinctive audio feature profiles of top hits.
- **MoodMap: Hit Predictions:** A prediction of the top genre and track based on mood, followed by an analysis of where they would be most listened to today.
